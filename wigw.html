					<h2><span class="under-yellow">What is Global Warming</span></h2>
					<p>Global warming means the temperature on planet Earth is rising. This is bad. A warmer planet means melting ice caps, rising sea-levels, increased threat of flooding. It also means farm land drying out which means less food can be produced. Global warming also has an affect on weather patterns too.</p>

					<h2><span class="under-green">What causes Global Warming</span></h2>
					<p>The burning of fossil fuels leads to increased amounts of Greenhouse Gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and radiate it back to the Earth. Too much of these gases in the atmosphere leads to the planet getting too warm. These gases include:
						<ul>
							<li>Water Vapour</li>
							<li>Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
							<li>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</li>
							<li>Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</li>
						</ul>
					The most prevalent greenhouse gas is CO2.
	
					<br>Burning fossil fuels releases CO2. Trees store CO2 for photosynthesis and when they are killed they release this stored CO2. Cutting down trees, called deforestation, releases this CO2 into the atmosphere, adding to global warming.</p>

					<h2><span class="under-blue">Facts</span></h2>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>Industrialization, deforestation, and pollution have greatly increased atmospheric concentrations of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, all greenhouse gases that help trap heat near Earth's surface. </li>
							<li>Some experts point out that natural cycles in Earth's orbit can alter the planet's exposure to sunlight, which may explain the current trend. Earth has indeed experienced warming and cooling cycles roughly every hundred thousand years due to these orbital shifts, but such changes have occurred over the span of several centuries. Today's changes have taken place over the past hundred years or less.</li>
							<li>Average temperatures have climbed 0.8 degree Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) around the world since 1880, much of this in recent decades, according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.</li>
							<li>The rate of warming is increasing. The 20<sup>th</sup> century's last two decades were the hottest in 400 years and possibly the warmest for several millennia, according to a number of climate studies. And the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 11 of the past 12 years are among the dozen warmest since 1850.</li>
							<li>With the start of industry in the 1700's, humans began emitting more fossil fuels from coal, oil, and gas to run our cars, trucks, and factories. By driving a “smarter” car you will not only save on petrol, but help prevent global warming. </li>
